# Heart-Disease-Analysis
An Excel data analytics project using clinical data obtained from Kaggle

This project analyses clinical data obtained from a Kaggle data set to determine patterns in presentation of heart disease among patients. 
The analysis reveals that the data sample contains a higher ratio of males to females, and certain slight variations in the pattern of occurrence of heart disease. 

Heart disease by age-group is analysed to understand the correlation between advanced age and heart failure, and peak occurence is determined in the 50-60 yrs group. The numbers plateau afterwards. 
In addition, blood pressure is categorised by their values into normal, slighly elevated, high, and critical, and these are used as well to understand the patterns of occurence of heart disease, juxtaposed alongside blood cholesterol volume readings.
