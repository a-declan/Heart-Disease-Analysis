# Heart-Disease-Analysis
An Excel data analytics project using clinical data obtained from Kaggle
This project analyses clinical data obtained from a Kaggle data set to detrmine patterns in presentation of heart disease among patients. 
The analysis reveals that the data sample contains a higher ratio of males to females, and certain slight variations in the pattern of occurrence of heart disease. 
Heart disease by age-group is analysed to uderstand the correlation between advanced age and heart failure, and peak occurence is determined in the 50-60yrs group. The numbers plateau afterwards. 
In addition, blood pressure is categorised by their value into normal, slighly elevated, high, and critical, and this is used as well to understand the patterns of occurence of heart disease, juxtaposed alongside blood cholesterol volume readings.
